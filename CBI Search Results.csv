Applied Physical Sciences Corporation,,"Applied Physical Sciences Corp. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Robust Deployable Acoustic Node (RDAN).  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Applied Physical Sciences Corp. working with L-3 Communications Maripro will develop a trawl-resistant, Robust Deployable Acoustic Node (RDAN). The RDAN technology will enable the U.S. Navy to install and operate acoustic underwater training ranges in shallow water environment to enhance fleet readiness. The acoustic sensor on the node will be specially designed to provide excellent acoustic fidelity as a tracking hydrophone while maintaining a relatively low profile to minimize risk from commercial fishing activities. The RDAN system will be deployable from vessels-of-opportunity rather than specialized cable laying ships. Commercialization within the U.S. Navy and the oil and gas industry will be pursued.

Applied Physical Sciences Corp. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Compact, Efficient Motor Controllers with Active Noise Cancellation.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Most commercial motor controllers (MC's) operate at relatively low switching frequency that produces a detectable acoustic signature and therefore drives the Navy to procure MC's operating at higher frequencies in order to reduce acoustic signature. These custom MC's, however, still generate significant noise, are not sufficiently reliable, and have obsolete components. APS will develop an innovative active noise and vibration cancellation (ANVC) system to reduce the acoustic and vibration signatures of today's commercial MC's to levels that will not contribute to the host vehicle's acoustic vulnerability. The APS ANVC system will mitigate noise and vibration generated by multiple internal sources and transmitted to the hull by either structure-borne or air-borne paths. The system will be comprised entirely of COTS components thereby minimizing cost and facilitating technology refresh. Key products of Phase 1 include: ' Measurements on a representative COTS MC to provide engineering data essential to ANVC system design ' A preliminary design for the proof-of-principle system to be developed and demonstrated in Phase 2 that will obtain at least 90% (i.e., 10 dB) reduction in broadband noise power The Phase 2 proof-of-principle system will provide the basis for DT&E of an operational prototype in Phase 3. BENEFITS: According to the recent 'USSOCOM Technology Needs Briefing for Center of Excellence for Research in Ocean Sciences' prepared by PEO-Naval Systems, Advanced Maritime Systems, 'SOF combatant submersibles (CS) require lower cost HM&E technology for dry manned submersibles.' The proposed technology directly addresses this need. However, the application and benefits will extend far beyond noise mitigation for motor controllers for dry manned submersibles. Not only will the MC-ANVC technologies developed under this effort be widely applicable to noise mitigation of small to moderate size motor controllers in any noise-critical Naval platform, the technology will be generally applicable to any machinery or equipment that generates noise and vibration. Thus there is wide industrial as well as military application and benefit from this technology.

Applied Physical Sciences Corp. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Mobile Offshore Platform for Wind Turbine Power Generation.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: There is a Department of Defense need for a persistent, mobile power generating capability to service offshore bases and other temporary or mobile installations. In order to facilitate both persistence and mobility, the present concept is of a free floating wind turbine platform, convertible from generating mode to transit mode. Challenges to design of this concept include stability, seakeeping, convertibility, and dynamic positioning. The most significant challenge is to overcome the large aerodynamic drag which is necessarily associated with power extraction from the wind. With conventional thrusters, the power required to overcome the aerodynamic drag is larger than the power generated by the turbine up through moderate wind speeds. Lacking a mooring system to maintain position, alternative concepts to counter the drag must be considered to realize surplus power through a significant range of conditions. The proposed concept seeks to counter aerodynamic turbine drag with passive propulsion, utilizing the motion of the platform response in waves to generate hydrodynamic thrust. Dynamic positioning, required for the platform to maintain station within 25 feet, can include elements of passive propulsion in thrust vectoring to further reduce power consumption.

Applied Physical Sciences Corp. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: High Fidelity Clutter Model for Active Sonar.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Active sonar clutter usually appears on a display as an amalgamation of point scatterers that exhibit both object and individual reflective and kinematic behavior. We propose to demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a realistic active sonar clutter model based on a few generalized concepts to synthesize most clutter types observed on Mid- Frequency active sonars. Realism is achieved by using the statistics of known clutter object attributes obtained from existing databases. The clutter model uses superellipsoids to define basic building blocks. Each type of clutter block is populated with discrete point scatters. The population, density, scattering coefficient, velocity, and fading characteristics of the scatterers are described using the appropriate statistics. The acoustic propagation response function for each scatterer is obtained using a high fidelity acoustic model. A realistic time series of a clutter object echo is obtained by convolving the transmit waveform with the system, propagation and clutter object response functions. Because all the functions, save one, are represented as delta functions, this is not computationally intensive. The model includes the effects of own ship motion, the specific sonar design, waveforms, and acoustic propagation including attenuation and multipath arrivals. The clutter exhibits deterministic and stochastically dependent, spatial, temporal, and intensity characteristics.

Applied Physical Sciences Corp. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Uncertainty Estimation for Atmospheric Acoustic Propagation Prediction.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: The propagation of acoustic signatures from vehicles, aircraft, boats and artillery can have a significant impact on military operations. Specifically combatants need to reliably detect enemy acoustic signatures while at the same time concealing their own. The physical propagation environment, including surface and atmospheric parameters, may drastically alter the range at which an emitting object may be detected. There are currently several models for predicting these acoustic propagation effects based on atmospheric profiles and/or ground topography. Unfortunately these models are sensitive to errors in environmental inputs. We propose a method for estimating the uncertainty (variance) of the acoustic propagation prediction given the uncertainty in the environmental inputs. Advantages to this new method are (1) it fits within current Parabolic Equation (PE) marching algorithms and does not require a second stand-alone code and (2) it is computationally efficient. This would allow our forces to simultaneously predict both the acoustic propagation and its uncertainty. The algorithm used to calculate the uncertainty may also be used to determine the sensitivity of the sound field to the various individual environmental parameters which could aid (1) in acoustic environmental parameter inversion and (2) in the intelligent allocation of meteorological measurement resources.

Applied Physical Sciences Corp. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) Sonobuoy.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: During the Phase I Base Effort, an omni-directional hydrophone will be designed and tested for prospective use in a ULF sonobuoy application. The design will be based on a sensor that was previously developed for an unrelated ULF application, but will generally fit within design envelope of the AN/SSQ-53F calibrated omni. The Base Effort will also entail evaluation of three different hydromechanical suspension systems that are adaptations of the suspension system employed by the AN/SSQ-53F DIFAR sonobuoy. The overall sonobuoy system architecture will also be developed during the Base Effort and will largely be driven by the hydrophone and hydromechanical suspension system design. The Phase I Option will entail an in situ evaluation of the hydrophone and hydromechanical suspension system at ultra-low frequencies. A majority of the experiments will be performed at the Lapel Test Facility operated by USSI.

Applied Physical Sciences Corp. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Sonobuoy System and Concept of Operations for Time-Reversal-Based Target Detection.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Existing multistatic airborne ASW systems require high power sources and are unable exploit the significant forward scattering target strengths due to the blinding presence of the direct blast. Time reversal (TR) is a recent method for focusing acoustic energy at a point using a pair of vertical line transducer arrays and offers the opportunity to exploit forward scattering from submarines. TR focusing can provide a measure of propagation channel stability, which provides a means for determining when the medium is disrupted as would occur when a scatterer such as a submarine passes between the two arrays. Moreover, because there is significant spatio-temporal focusing gain to be had with TR, there exists the opportunity to use lower power transmissions. Here we propose to determine the feasibility of a TR sonobuoy system for airborne ASW in the frequency band of a DICASS (AN/SSQ-62) sonobuoy and using vertical line arrays similar in dimension to a VLAD (AN/SSQ-77) sonobuoy. Operating at DICASS frequencies allows for achievable array apertures, exploits extremely high forward target strengths (> 50 dB) and improves the sensitivity of the TR. Post Phase I efforts would include implementing modifications to existing sonobuoy hardware for in-water demonstrations.

Applied Physical Sciences Corp. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: An Interactive Acoustic Approach for Mitigation of Impacts on Marine Mammals.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Applied Physical Sciences Corp.

The system will use vector hydrophones to passively detect, track, classify, and localize vocalizing mammals. Using species identification, behavior recognition, and ranging, safe-level acoustic signals will be transmitted to encourage the animals to leave the operations area. Proof-of-concept experiments on captive animals will be performed in phase I, and once permitting is secured in phase II, an in-situ test will be performed on wild pods to demonstrate the effectiveness of a prototype system.

Applied Physical Sciences Corp. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Distributed Sensor System Innovations.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: The overall intent of this project is to produce cost-effective component technologies that will facilitate the development of compact sensing nodes which are utilized by deep submergence vector sensing line arrays. The principle application for this effort is targeted for the augmented reliable acoustic path vector sensing line array. In that regard, the Phase I study will develop a prototype compact vector sensor housing together with an integrated omni-directional pressure hydrophone that will (1) meet the electronic noise floor and submergence depth criteria imposed on the prototype device currently in production and (2) be produced at substantially lower costs than the prototype device. These components will be designed using the results from analytical modeling, numerical modeling, and proof-of-principle laboratory experiments. It should be stated that, while this SBIR Phase I project addresses the development of a compact vector sensor housing containing an integrated pressure hydrophone, APS plans to leverage the results from SBIR Topic N07-076 ""Naval Device Applications of Relaxor Piezoelectric Single Crystals"" to address the development of a compact pressure-gradient hydrophone. The results of both SBIR projects will be used together during Phase II in which a series of prototype vector sensors will be fabricated and tested.

Applied Physical Sciences Corp. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Naval Device Applications of Relaxor Piezoelectric Single Crystals.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: The overall intent of this project is to develop a series of miniature vector sensors for statically deployed and towed array applications. In each of these applications the sensor will be required to have an operational bandwidth commensurate with the passive ASW frequency range and an electronic noise floor below sea-state zero. In that regard, the Phase I study comprises of an evaluation to (1) determine which type of pressure-gradient hydrophone (i.e., either inertial or diffraction) is best suited for the application and (2) which single crystal transduction mode (i.e., extension or shear) is best suited for miniaturization. These tasks will be accomplished using analytical and numerical models along with proof-of-principle experiments. At the conclusion of Phase I a pre-prototype miniature biaxial vector sensor, suitable for submarine thin-line towed array applications, will be fabricated and tested. During Phase II, several application-specific miniature vector sensors will be fabricated and tested in laboratory and field environments to ascertain their performance under conditions that are consistent with those encountered in situ. The sensors developed during Phase II will contain integrated electronics.",Aerospace & Defense,,,,,United States,,U.S. Department of Defense,,Grant - VIII,8/10/2009,,0%,Alive / Active,,,

Scientific Applications & Research Assoc.,scientific.gr,"Scientific Applications & Research Assoc. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Radio Frequency External Load Position Monitoring System.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: A common mission for helicopters is to move heavy loads suspended on a cable attached to a hook or winch system. During flight, the aerodynamic and inertial forces acting on the load can cause it to swing in the lateral and/or longitudinal directions. Load pendulum motions can also be excited as the helicopter maneuvers, potentially leading to dangerous situations resulting in loss of the load or endangering the helicopter and its crew. Modern manned and unmanned helicopters replace manual controls with fly-by-wire control systems that improve flight stability and reduce pilot workload by using feedback loops to compensate for changes in flight dynamics. SARA's proposed Radio Frequency External Load Position Monitoring System uses an array of receiver antennas mounted on the helicopter lower fuselage to track dynamic motion of two small, low-power radio transmitters located on the load to provide accurate, reliable load dynamic motion feedback under all visibility conditions, including brown-out. This compact (<5 lbs) system uses proprietary superresolution pointing algorithms to provide angular measurement accuracy of better than 0.1 degree. Existing flight-proven hardware will enable demonstration of measurement range and accuracy during Phase I and speed transition to an operational system in Phase II

Scientific Applications & Research Assoc. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Innovative Millimeter-Wave Imaging System for Detecting Metal Defects through Polyurethane Coatings.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: A continuing theme in shipboard monitoring is the need to inspect hulls of boats and submarines for signs of metal fatigue, typically manifesting as weld breaks, corrosion, and for submarines, metal-polymer debonding. Visual inspection remains the most reliable diagnostic, but is cumbersome if paint or plastic must be removed to reach the metal. Non- invasive diagnostics have problems too: eddy-current monitoring is reliable for weld fatigue, but not for corrosion onset or debonding, and polymers are opaque to ultrasound. Because missing a defect is unacceptable, existing non-visual methods are inherently slow. SARA proposes a millimeter-wave (MMW) imaging system, based on the science used for airport body scanners, to inspect welds without needing to remove the insulating layer. Because structural polymers typically have windows of transparency in the MMW domain, this technology provides rapid 'see-thru' imaging of metal and associated defects in steel (such as those in butt/fillet welds, and corrosion onset). Stand-off scanning of a MMW imager will enable the Navy to localize weld joints and corrosion on quarter-wave scales (1mm or less), and will detect hairline cracks of even smaller scale. Debonding will be measured by phase rotation of multipath reflection, which only occurs when an air/water gap is present.

Scientific Applications & Research Assoc. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Bioweapon Identification and Triggering by Ionization Signatures.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Modern bioweapon detection systems are highly accurate, but require expensive reagents to operate. To reduce costs, a less discriminate trigger system is used to signal the primary detector when a suspicious aerosol is present. Currently deployed UV fluorescence based trigger systems operate successfully, but only work with fluorescent bioweapons. An advanced technology is urgently needed to address bioweapon threats that do not fluoresce under UV light. The measurement of the ionization signatures of bioaerosol particles created by an electrostatic field is a technology that offers a solution. Aerosol is passed through a high intensity electric field that ionizes the particles and leaves them electrically charged in a unique pattern. The particles are then impacted on an electrode and the resulting current flows are measured. The relatively weak electrical signals are then analyzed with a suite of higher order statistical and spectral methods termed Fluctuation Enhanced Sensing (FES). The calculated FES parameters are examined and searched for known patterns indicating the presence of a dangerous aerosol. Once a probable threat is detected, the trigger system signals the main detection system to sample the air and make a more accurate discrimination.

Scientific Applications & Research Assoc. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: RCS-Reduction and EMI-Suppression Technology for HPM Antennas.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Successful platform-integration of high power microwave (HPM) directed energy weapons (DEW) poses very demanding challenges. Unwanted radiation (near-field and far-field) and surface currents locally induced around HPM aperture boundaries raise serious risks of suicide (effects upon the host platform) and fratricide (effects upon nearby friendly or non-targeted systems). These risks must be addressed, and substantially reduced, before such systems can be operated and fielded with confidence. In addition, the nature of anticipated HPM-based missions is such that avoidance of radar detection (or at least, identification) of the platform is highly desirable. Unfortunately, high-gain HPM antennas can exhibit large radar cross sections (RCS) that enhance both detection and identification. Established antenna RCS-suppression techniques, which operate primarily as frequency filters (i.e., frequency selective surfaces, or FSS) tend to concentrate electric fields at dense arrays of locations across apertures. For an HPM- transmitting aperture, this encourages breakdown and severely limits realizable output power per area. We propose to develop practical, realizable, innovative engineering solutions to both types of problems via a methodical program of analyses, modeling, design, and experimentation that will: (1) extend usable FSS RCS-reduction technology into the HPM-capable domain; and (2) establish novel and effective platform- and HPM- compatible EMI-suppression methods.BENEFIT:HPM-compatible RCS-reduction and EMI-suppression are essential enabling technologies for successful military applications of HPM-based directed energy weapons (DEW). Technology resulting from this project will speed advancement/transition of HPM-based directed energy weaponry from the laboratory to the warfighter. Commercial technology spinoffs and applications in EMI suppression are also possible.

Scientific Applications & Research Assoc. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Small UAV Accurate Geolocation and Discrimination.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: The system-level design of a geolocation system for detecting and locating RF emitters on a small, unmanned aerial vehicle (SUAV) will be competed. The design will include system-level design, sensor subsystem design, RF receiver subsystem design, DSP subsystem design, and geolocation algorithms. The COTS components necessary to fabricate the system under the Phase II program will be identified. A mission-level simulation will be developed so that the systems accuracy can be evaluated. The simulation will allow for characterizing the systems geolocation performance with multiple emitters and various emitter locations. System fabrication and integration onto an Air Force platform will be done during Phase II. Field testing will be conducted during Phase II to demonstrate and quantify the systems geolocation performance.BENEFIT:Miltary uses of this system include locating enemy communication radios, cell phones, data links, jammers, remote detonation transmitters, and radars. Specific applications include Blue Force tracking or Combat Search and Rescue. The technology is platform independent and could be used on manned airplanes, helicopters, tanks, APCs, and as a hand-held unit for troops. For civialian applications, DHS has tasked the FAA to address the risk of US airports being disrupted by RF emitters such as GPS jammers in the midcourse and approach airspaces. A hand-held variant of this system could readily assist DHS enforcement teams in locating such devices. Smaller low cost units could be used at each airport for monitoring FAA communication channels to ensure flight safety. Additional civilian applications include distress situations to locate boaters for USCG Rescue 21 type applications, hikers using their cell phone, and enhanced 911 applications.

Scientific Applications & Research Assoc. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Autonomous Control Technologies for Terminal Area Operations.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) participation in controlled airspace requires that the UAV behave just as a human-piloted aircraft. Forward airbases with Air Traffic Control (ATC) can be complex when considering ATC commands, localization in a GPS denied environment, flight restrictions, FAA rules, and dynamic obstacles. SARA proposes a behavior-based system that deconfliction these complexities, allowing the UAV to operate safely in the Terminal Area of Operations (TAO). The proposed behavior-based ""Autonomous Pilot"" uses concurrent simple behaviors to produce emergent complex behaviors. An objective function based solver calculates weights and preferred actions of the individual behaviors to arbitrate an optimum vehicle action. To facilitate development and eventual transfer of the Autonomous Pilot to actual UAV hardware, SARA proposes a modular control architecture. Our proposed ""Autonomous Pilot- Multi-Objective Deconfliction"" (APMOD) system is based on the ""Mission Oriented Operating Suite"" (MOOS) architecture. The modularity allows simulation modules during the development phase to be replaced with hardware integration modules as the program develops into hardware-in-the-loop solutions and eventually into actual UAV platforms.

Scientific Applications & Research Assoc. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Advanced Hemispherical Reflectance Measurement of Heated Materials.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Measurements of Total Hemispherical Reflectance under high temperature conditions are needed for accurate assessment of lethality functions of the ABL program. During engagement by high power lasers, the surface temperature of solid targets changes rapidly causing drastic variations in the absorption and reflection characteristics. Current hemispherical reflectance measurement systems cannot perform under such fast heating rates (100 degrees per second). SARA's proposed methodologies to address this shortcoming will be addressed by investigating alternative techniques aimed at measuring Total Hemispherical Reflectance. In particular, we will demonstrate the possibility of measuring the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of a target under the fast heating rates of interest. Hardware and methodologies to perform such measurement will be presented and the BRDF of representative military targets (4130 steel and 6061 Aluminum) will be performed using an in-house two-kilowatt CW Nd:YAG laser capable of irradiating samples at 10 kW/cm2 and producing sample heating rates of hundreds of degrees per second. Software to derive the Total Hemispherical Reflectance from BRDF measurements will be developed. The results will be applied to the design of a subscale device in Phase II and scalability to full deployment in a field environment for a Phase III device will be demonstrated.

Scientific Applications & Research Assoc. is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Direct Diode Pumped Blue-Green Laser.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Present Blue-Green lasers are inefficient (0.5 - 2.0 %) owing to the losses incurred by using multiple/cascaded solid-state and two or more nonlinear optical frequency conversion stages. We propose to develop a simpler approach to a blue-green efficient system: Single-state diode laser pump light in = blue-green laser pulses out To achieve this we will bring together advances in diode lasers/super-luminescent LEDs to provide ""in-band"" pumping of pulsed and frequency tunable gain media. The candidate systems emerged from a long term internal effort at SARA to identify new systems with output in the blue-green and other regions of the visible spectrum. SARA's corporate mission is to pursue new technologies and develop highly innovative applications for existing technologies. Within our laser system development projects we focus upon realizing the performance and efficiency inherent in entirely new and previously not well developed laser systems. In addition SARA is well versed in laser detection and tracking systems for applications with technologies including reflected light detection (optical LIDAR type missions), and the challenges facing the applications of lasers to underwater detection and tracking and optical communication in water.",Aerospace & Defense,,"Hydrogen Energy Tech, Aerospace & Space Tech",,,United States,,U.S. Department of Defense,,Grant - VII,10/22/2009,,0%,Alive / Active,,,
